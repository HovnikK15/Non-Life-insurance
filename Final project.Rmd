## Importing dataset

```{r, echo=F}
#Okolje, kjer pišeš kodo - Ta celotni kvadratek skopiras, ko kaj rabiš
```

First, we need to import Insurance contract data from the file `NonFleetCo507` into R. The file contains 159.947 contracts with 11 variables. The column `Clm Count` shows how many claims were filed on the contract. This is the loss frequency data that we will use for model fitting. The column `TLength` shows the period of exposure during which the contract was active and the Clm Count was filed. 

```{r, echo=F}
mtpl_orig <- read.delim("NonFleetCo507.txt", header = TRUE)
mtpl_orig=as_tibble(mtpl_orig)
str(mtpl_orig)
#summary(mtpl_orig)
head(mtpl_orig)

```
**Tu lahko dodama opis tabele, torej kaj kaj predstavlja, kaj je max, min..

We could rename colums in our dataset to make it easier to work with. We will rename the column `Clm_Count` into `nclaims` as the number of claims, and `TLength` into `expo` as exposure. For easier programming we will also rename `AgeInsued` and `SexInsured` into `age` and `sex`.
```{r, echo=F}
#We don't need all the colums, so we can make new table which has only imporant colums about insurance contract
mtpl <- mtpl_orig %>% select(-PrivateCar, -VehCapCubic, -VehCapTonn)
dim(mtpl)
mtpl <- mtpl_orig %>%
  # rename all columns 
  rename_all(function(.name) {
    .name %>% 
      # replace all names with the lowercase versions
      tolower 
    })
mtpl <- rename(mtpl, nclaims = clm_count,expo = tlength, sex = sexinsured, age = ageinsured )

```

First, we can  calculate empirical claim frequency, per unit of exposure. We see that we get `0.154`. 

```{r first-risk-calculations-mtpl-2, echo = F, warning=FALSE}
mtpl %>% summarize(emp_freq = sum(nclaims) / sum(expo))
```

If we do the same for each gender we see that claim frequency is higher for males than females.

```{r, echo = F, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
mtpl %>% 
  group_by(sex) %>% summarize(emp_freq = sum(nclaims) / sum(expo)) %>% kable(format = "html") 
```

We can show number of claims on the graph. We can observe that the number of actual claims represents only a small proportion of all insurance contracts.
```{r}

g <- ggplot(mtpl, aes(nclaims)) + theme_bw() + 
     geom_bar(aes(weight = expo), col = "red", 
              fill = "red", alpha = 0.5) + 
     labs(y = "Abs freq (in exposure)") +
     ggtitle("MTPL - number of claims")
g
```
Looking at this in relative terms, we can see that in average almost more than 80% of insurance contract did not have any claims. 
```{r}
g <- ggplot(mtpl, aes(nclaims)) + theme_bw()
g + geom_bar(aes(y = (..count..)/sum(..count..)), 
    col = "red", fill = "red", alpha = 0.5) + 
  labs(y = "Relative frequency") +
  ggtitle("MTPL - relative number of claims")
```






This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
